  <h1>Eating Light: A Resilient Diet for Health and the Planet</h1>
  <h2>Grains, greens, and the power of moderation</h2>

  <p>For most of modern history, we‚Äôve been taught that being wealthy meant having access to expensive, high-prestige foods: rich meats, exotic imports, endless variety. But what if true wealth is having the freedom to eat simply ‚Äî and still thrive?</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been quietly simplifying my diet. Instead of chasing variety, I‚Äôve leaned into wholesome staples like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Organic <strong>quinoa</strong>, oats, and rice</li>
    <li>In-season, locally grown <strong>vegetables</strong></li>
    <li>Occasional animal products, treated as supplements ‚Äî not staples</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The result? Lower costs. Better digestion. Simpler cooking. And a lifestyle that aligns with both health and environmental goals.</p>

  <h2>Why It Works</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grains are efficient.</strong> Calorie for calorie, plant-based staples require fewer resources than animal products. Growing grains to feed humans ‚Äî not livestock ‚Äî is radically more efficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal vegetables maximize nutrition</strong> and minimize transport emissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple meals reduce decision fatigue</strong> and impulse spending ‚Äî both in the store and at restaurants.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderation avoids dogma.</strong> You don‚Äôt need to be vegan to benefit. Just shifting the baseline makes a difference.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Case for Simplicity</h2>
  <p>Think about what this diet supports:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>üß† Mental clarity (fewer decisions, better focus)</li>
    <li>üí∞ Financial flexibility (bulk buying, fewer perishables)</li>
    <li>üåç Environmental impact (less land, water, and carbon)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It‚Äôs not about purity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about <em>direction</em>. Every step toward lightness frees you up to live with more intention.</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúA moderate man is rich, even with little.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>If you‚Äôre looking for a way to eat that serves your body, your budget, and the bigger picture ‚Äî this might be your on-ramp.</p>
