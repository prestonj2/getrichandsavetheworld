    <h1>Reverse Osmosis Systems: Cleaner Water with a Cleaner Conscience</h1>

    <p>
        If you're looking to reduce waste, improve your family's health, and feel more in control of your water quality,
        a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system may be the right tool for the job. In a world where plastic bottles pile up and trust in municipal or well water quality varies, RO systems offer a middle path: clean, filtered water—without the landfill.
    </p>

    <h2>How RO Systems Work</h2>
    <p>
        RO systems use pressure to push water through a semipermeable membrane that removes up to 99% of dissolved salts,
        lead, residual pharmaceuticals, chlorine, fluoride, and microplastics. Typical systems include a sediment pre-filter, carbon block filter, the RO membrane, and a post-carbon polishing filter. Some models add remineralization or UV sterilization stages.
    </p>

    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s face it: tap water has the lowest environmental impact—especially when it’s safe and palatable. However, for
        those who choose bottled water instead, RO systems offer a massive improvement. A single household switching from bottled water to an RO system can avoid thousands of plastic bottles per year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wastewater production is a concern—older RO units could waste 3-4 gallons for every 1 gallon filtered. Modern
        systems reduce this ratio to near 1:1. Some can be paired with rainwater or greywater reuse strategies to further mitigate this.
    </p>

    <h2>Cost and Maintenance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Cost:</strong> $150–$300 for a high-quality under-sink unit</li>
        <li><strong>Replacement Filters:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-filters (sediment + carbon): ~$15 every 6–12 months</li>
                <li>RO Membrane: ~$30–$60 every 2–3 years</li>
                <li>Post-filter: ~$15 every 12 months</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation and Usability</h2>
    <p>
        Under-sink RO units are straightforward to install for most homeowners with basic plumbing skills. Key pitfalls to
        avoid:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insufficient water pressure (below 40 PSI may require a booster pump)</li>
        <li>Improper sealing at fittings or storage tank valves</li>
        <li>Leaks due to worn-out o-rings during filter replacement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that RO water can taste "flat" due to lack of minerals—remineralizing cartridges solve this easily.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        RO systems aren't perfect, but they strike a powerful balance: they empower households to produce reliable, clean water
        with far less waste than bottled alternatives. They're a step toward decentralization, resilience, and stewardship.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        Technically speaking, if you're happy with your tap water, there’s no lower-impact option than drinking it straight. But
        if you’re not—this might be the best of both worlds.
